# Apply a patch to a project's repository:
# '-v' for verbose
git apply -v path/file.patch

# You can also use --index setting to track modified files: 
git apply -v --index path/file.patch

# Reverse the patch:
git apply -R path/file.patch

[Single line]
curl https://www.drupal.org/files/[patch-name].patch | git -v apply -

[Without Git]
# Apply a patch
patch < file.patch

# The -p option tells patch how many leading prefixes to strip. For patches created using git, -p1 is normally the right option, and is the default for git apply. If that doesn't work, try either of the above commands with -p0 instead.
patch -p1 < path/file.patch


# Reverse the patch (If your patch was applied with the -p0 option, use that instead.)
patch -p1 -R < path/file.patch
