#Pack
tar -zcvf archive-name.tar.gz directory-name --exclude=.idea
#UnPack
tar -xvzf archive-name.tar.gz.tar.gz

f: this must be the last flag of the command, and the tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the name and path of the compressed file.
z: tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip
x: tar can collect files or extract them. x does the latter.
v: makes tar talk a lot. Verbose output shows you all the files being extracted.
